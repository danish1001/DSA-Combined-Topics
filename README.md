## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danish1001/DSA-Combined-Topics.git
cd DSA-Combined-Topics
```

2. **Open in IDE**
- Use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
- Navigate to any folder and run the `main()` method of the Java class

3. **Understand the Logic**
- Each class includes a clean method with proper logic breakdown
- Add your test cases or use provided comments for input/output

## 🚀 Future Plans

- [ ] Add links to original problems in comments
- [ ] Include problem statements as doc-comments or markdown
- [ ] Add JUnit test cases for selected problems
- [ ] Add time & space complexity annotations
